## What I actually do every day 

--

🏡💻 **Work in a fun team**: Work with a fun interdisciplinary team of scientists, developers, marketing savvy.

--

📙 **Learn**: Learn the intricacies and amazingness of mass spectrometry (= most used technique to quantify proteins in a sample) & what life scientists need to make the best use of their experiment.

--

👩‍💻 **Code in R**: Assemble workflows in R to analyse mass spectrometry data.

--

👐 **Open Science**: Learn and strive for reproducibility and openness in what we produce.

--

🥜 **In a nutshell**: Study & Learn, think, build solutions (mainly in R packages)‚ debug, debug, debug, repeat.

## Developing a datasets based R package to teach environmental data science

#### Author and speaker: Allison Horst 

- 🔗[Introduced the `{lterdatasampler}`](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/): LTER Data Sampler 📦 (LTER = Long Term Ecological Research program (LTER) Network)
- LTER goal is education and training

--

#### Lesson learnt from this talk

- A great way to learn how to build an R 📦 is to create a data-package (package that only includes data)

--

- I don't have super complex, cool new functions... I cannot write an R 📦

--

- Free gift! Data packages are an enormously useful tool for teaching purposes (how many times have you used the [`{iris}` dataset [1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)??!!) 

.footnote[R. A. Fisher (1936). "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems". Annals of Eugenics. 7 (2): 179–188. doi:10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x. hdl:2440/15227]

## Creating R packages: resources that I found super useful!

Get started with 🔗[R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) by Hadley Wickham. Easy to read and very comprehensive.  

What you need to get started:

1. Code (one function is enough) AND/OR data (it doesn't have to be large!)

--

2. An R project in a new folder `/path/to/myPackage`

--

3. Run the code `usethis::create_package("/path/to/myPackage")` (more info https://r-pkgs.org/workflows101.html). 
This will create the metadata and other files that you need to package the package up!

--

4. You're setup!


---

## To recapitulate: Setup your R package in a few lines!

```{r eval=FALSE}

usethis::use_data(data_fake) #<<

# R in production

---

## What does "R in production" mean?

Example from my experience. 
- 👩‍💻 I'm a data scientist at Mass Dynamics and I build R 📦  to analyse mass spectrometry data

--

- But, Mass Dynamics wants to make the functionalities of the R packages easily available also to 👩‍🔬  life scientist, reducing the barrier of having to learn to code  

--

- The solution: the life scientist can interact with an easy user interface (UI, aka *frontend*) which runs my R 📦  in the background (aka *backend*) 

--

- Every time a scientist interacts with the UI, the R 📦  is run -> This is R in production 🎉! 

---

## How do we do that? 

There is a bit of engineering setup and jargon to digest & there are various of way of accomplishing this task!

--

Tricky aspects:

--

- A lot of aspects are around the engineering setup (which is not my expertise!)

--

- However, from my side I need to make sure that:
  - all dependencies needed by my R packages are available in production
  
--

  - all packages are put into production with a defined version to allow *reproducibility*
  
--

  - Managing dependencies can be really tricky!
    - How do you know all that you need, when a package will depends on another package, and anothe rpackage will depend on another one etc...

---

## What are package dependencies?

--

You find them in the `DESCRIPTION` file of a package, disguising under:

- `Depends`, `Imports`, `SystemRequirements` (dependencies external from R)

- Example from the `{sf}` 📦 https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/blob/master/DESCRIPTION

---

## How to find them all?

How do you determine all the dependencies needed to reproduce an R package/project environment to make it reporodcible, open, shareable, safe for production?

My summary of suggestions after discussing with speakers at useR! 2021:

- [`{renv}` 📦](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html):
  - is the emerging method to manage package/project dependencies in R. 
  - Calling `renv::snapshot()` saves the state of the project library to the lockfile (called `renv.lock`)
  - Really useful but for a given project it could give you more than you need (may affect speed).

--

- Hard code your dependency, start minimal and grow:
  - It's really useful to grow your dependency list little by little. 
  - Start with package `imports` (looking at the `DESCRIPTION` file) and then look for system dependencies 

---

## Ways to find out system dependencies of a 📦

- [r-hub/sysreqs 📦](https://github.com/r-hub/sysreqs)  provides a database with API to quickly find out which packages or other software needs to be available to build and use R packages.

  - Usage: `sysreqs::sysreq_commands(desc = "path/to/a/DESCRIPTION/file")` runs all the commands to install the necessary runtime system dependencies.
